#  Tecnologías de comunicación para IoT (Communication Technologies for IoT) 
## About this course
The course introduces the student to communication technologies of IoT, familiarizing them with current technologies for their implementation and going deeply into LoRaWAN and NB-IoT (including laboratories).
The course includes [lectures](slides/README.md), [laboratories](labs/README.md), and  final project. 

## About this teaching material
The first edition of this course was offered as continuing education, including LoRaWAN laboratories only. This new edition adds NB-IoT communication and updates the labs to lab-at-home methodology.  
The material available consists of [lectures](slides/README.md) and [laboratories](labs/README.md) (in Spanish).
More information, material, and active discussion forums can be found [here](https://eva.fing.edu.uy/course/view.php?name=tiot).
