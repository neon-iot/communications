#  Tecnologías de comunicación para IoT (Communication Technologies for IoT) 
## About this course
The course introduces the student to communication technologies of IoT, familiarizing them with current technologies for their implementation and going deeply into LoRaWAN and NB-IoT (incluing laboratories).

## About this teaching material
A first edition of this course was offer as continuing education, incluidng LoRaWAN laboratories only. This new editon adds NB-IoT communication and update the labs to lab-at-home metodology.  

## Main topics
* Introduction to IoT (Historical evolution, general architecture, study cases)
* Hardware platforms (nodes, sensors and actuators)
* Network and communication technologies: fundamentals and available technologies (such as 6LoWPAN, LoRa, NB-IoT, others).
* LoRa and LoRaWAN.
* NB-IoT.
* Application layer protocols (CoAP, MQTT).
* Security aspects. 

## What you will learn
* Challenges of communication tecnologies for IoT challenges.
* Main tecnologies and hardware options available today.
* Main concepts and implmentation of a communication stack.
* LoRaWAN and NB-IoT details.

## What you will need:
* Required skills:
    - Language C programming
    - Digital electrónics.
    - Analog electrónics.
    - Telecommunications basics .
